Here is a comprehensive plan for implementing the secure file-sharing system as described, with a focus on security and appropriate role handling, utilizing FastAPI, a contemporary, high-performance Python web framework, with a database of either MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (SQL).
Tech Stack
	•	Framework: FastAPI
	•	Database: MongoDB (via Motor) or PostgreSQL (via SQLAlchemy)
	•	Authentication: JWT-based
	•	Encryption: Fernet (from cryptography)
	•	Email Service: SMTP or 3rd-party (e.g., SendGrid)
	•	Testing: pytest, FastAPI’s TestClient
 User Roles
	•	Ops User:
	•	Login
	•	Upload files (.pptx, .docx, .xlsx only)
	•	Client User:
	•	Signup → receive encrypted verification URL
	•	Email verification
	•	Login
	•	List files
	•	Download files via secure encrypted URL
 Security & File ManagementFilename, owner, MIME type, encrypted download link, and created_at are among the metadata kept in the database. Files are stored on disk (or in an AWS S3/GCP bucket for production).• Create time-limited or one-time encrypted download links.Before permitting a download, confirm the user's role and ownership.
 Encrypted URL Logic
	•	Use Fernet encryption with a server-side key
	•	Include file ID, user ID, and expiry timestamp in encrypted payload
	•	Decrypt on access, verify expiry & user type
 Email Verification Flow
	•	On sign-up, generate a JWT token or encrypted URL
	•	Send via email with verification link
	•	On click, activate account
Auth APIs
POST   /auth/login
POST   /auth/signup   → Returns email verification link
GET    /auth/verify-email?token=...
File APIs (Ops User)
POST   /ops/upload
Client File APIs
GET    /client/files                    → List uploaded files
GET    /client/download/{file_id}      → Returns encrypted download link
GET    /secure-download/{encrypted_id} → Download the file securely
Sample Download Response
{
  "download-link": "/secure-download/fhdshf78wef7hwefh823hr==",
  "message": "success"
}
Testing Plan (with pytest)

Test cases should include:
	•	Ops upload with allowed/invalid file types
	•	Client signup → email verification → login
	•	Encrypted download URL generation
	•	Invalid user accessing secure URL
	•	Expired URL access test
 Deployment Plan

Production Deployment Options:
	•	Use Docker for containerization
	•	Host via Gunicorn + Uvicorn behind NGINX
	•	Use HTTPS (via Let’s Encrypt or similar)
	•	Store secrets securely (using environment variables or a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager)
	•	Use Celery + Redis for background tasks (e.g., sending emails)
	•	Store files in a cloud bucket (e.g., AWS S3) for scalability
	•	Monitor app with Prometheus + Grafana or Sentry
